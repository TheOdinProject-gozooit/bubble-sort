# Project: Bubble Sort

This project is part of my web development learning alongside The Odin Project.

## What's bubble sort ?

From Wikipedia:

> Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the input list element by element, comparing the current element with the one after it, swapping their values if needed. These passes through the list are repeated until no swaps had to be performed during a pass, meaning that the list has become fully sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way the larger elements "bubble" up to the top of the list.

Visual example:

## Assignment

Build a method `#bubble_sort` that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology (using #sort would be pretty pointless, wouldnâ€™t it?).

```ruby
> bubble_sort([4,3,78,2,0,2])
=> [0,2,2,3,4,78]
```
