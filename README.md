# Project: Bubble Sort

This project is part of my web development learning alongside The Odin Project.

You can find the related exercise [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/bubble-sort)

## Assignment

Build a method `#bubble_sort` that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology (using #sort would be pretty pointless, wouldnâ€™t it?).

```ruby
> bubble_sort([4,3,78,2,0,2])
=> [0,2,2,3,4,78]
```
